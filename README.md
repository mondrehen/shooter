2023.11.02 The tutorial want me to create a function, that the laser shall disappear after 2 sec later the shooting. A bug is occoured and not fixed yet. Just commit once first. <br>
2023.10.27 Bug fixed, reason for that is the projectiles node in main scene has a scale by accident.<br>
2023.10.26 In commit ee, there is a bug that the projectiles laser and grenade can be generated in the remote scene when the game is running. But the player cannot see it. Need to work on that to find a proper way to solve bugs like this in the future.<br>
